# R code to generate the posterior dose-response curve
This repository contains the R code supporting the paper ["A longitudinal Bayesian framework for estimating causal dose-response relationships"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20893).

The folder contains the R code for the generalized Bayesian bootstrap to estimate the dose–response relationship. 

BB_cont: Code to estimate the dose–response relationship with the Bayesian bootstrap framework for Example 1.
DP_cont: Code to estimate the dose–response relationship with the Dirichlet process framework for Example 1.
BB_Possion: Code to estimate the dose–response relationship with the Bayesian bootstrap framework for Example 2.
DP_Possion: Code to estimate the dose–response relationship with the Dirichlet process framework for Example 2.
